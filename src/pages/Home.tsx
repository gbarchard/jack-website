          Hello, I'm Jack Teske. I am an Illustrator from Atlanta Georgia. I
          studied at Ringling College of Art and Design. I have a knack for
          anything medieval. I have worked as a furniture designer at J Tribble
          antiques. On the side, I am creating a comic called "Templar" which is
          based off my Senior Thesis.
